Amazon Sales Data Analysis with Python
Bridging Data Insights and Real-World Solutions

Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets using Python. 
By combining technical expertise with an analytical mindset, I identified key trends in sales performance and provided actionable recommendations to optimize inventory, 
marketing strategies, and operational efficiency.

Objective
To analyze and uncover trends in sales data, demonstrating advanced data manipulation, visualization, and analysis skills to improve decision-making.
Highlights

Academic Rigor: Applied robust data analysis techniques, including exploratory analysis, trend identification, and correlation analysis.

Practical Impact: Delivered actionable insights for inventory optimization, seasonal marketing, and operational improvements.

Key Insights

1. Product Trends:
T-shirts are the top-selling category, highlighting the need to prioritize inventory.
Large (L) and Extra-Large (XL) dominate size preferences, with Medium (M) peaking seasonally in April.

2. Temporal Trends:
April consistently drives the highest sales, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions.

3. Geographical Insights:
Maharashtra is the leading state, contributing 16% of total sales. Secondary focus on Karnataka and Delhi could expand market share.

4. Operational Insights:
High fulfillment efficiency with most orders successfully delivered, signaling a robust supply chain.
Tools and Techniques
Python Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
numpy: For numerical operations.

Key Techniques:
Data Cleaning.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Visualization of categorical and temporal trends.
Correlation analysis to assess relationships between numerical variables.

Actionable Recommendations
1. Inventory Optimization:
Maintain high stock levels for top-selling items (T-shirts in L and XL).
Monitor and adjust inventory for M-sized items in April.

2. Seasonal Marketing:
Launch campaigns in March to extend April’s sales momentum.
Target promotions on T-shirts, emphasizing Medium-sized items in peak months.

3. Regional Focus:
Invest in marketing and supply chain efficiency for Maharashtra.
Expand secondary operations in Karnataka and Delhi.

4. Operational Efficiency:
Maintain fulfillment excellence while addressing minor inefficiencies in return/cancellation rates.
Limitations
Lack of customer demographic data restricted personalized analysis.
Limited external data (e.g., promotional history) hindered deeper causal analysis of sales spikes.

Data Source
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle. It provides a comprehensive overview of Amazon sales data.
